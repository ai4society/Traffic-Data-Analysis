# Traffic Data Analysis

This repository analyzes the effectiveness of the [Alive@25](https://www.scnsc.org/defensive-driving/alive-25) program in reducing the number of car accidents for young drivers in South Carolina. It includes various types of analysis such as geospatial analysis, collision data analysis, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- `code`: Contains the scripts used to run the analysis and visualizations.
- `data`: Contains the data required for the scripts inside the `code` folder.
- `output`: Contains the output HTML (interactive and static) and plots about the analysis done using the scripts in the `code` folder.

### Subfolders

Each main folder is divided into three subfolders:

- `Alive-25-analysis`: Focuses on analyzing the data related to the Alive@25 program.
- `collision-analysis`: Focuses on analyzing the collision data.
- `map-visualization`: Focuses on the map visualization of the data.

### Visualization

The [interactive traffic visualization](https://ai4society.github.io/Traffic-Data-Analysis/) stems from 3 files in the project root: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
